I built this project to improve my coding skills while streamlining a process at my last job. When a sales rep like myself brought on a new client and needed to introduce them to their next points of contact at my company, we sent a relatively similar email each time. It was necessary, however to change parts of the email in various places that took more time than I liked. I envisioned and impletemented a better process for the whole sales team. In order to use this tool, the sales rep simply entered the information specific to each new client at the top of the webpage, which in turn creates a custom email that the sales rep easily copy and pasted in their email and sent it to the new client.
